Description: Implemented is an algorithm to estimate the two-way fixed effect linear model. 
    The coefficients of interest are computed using the residuals from the 
    projection of all variables on the two sets of fixed effects. Our algorithm
    has three desirable features. First, it manages memory and computational 
    resources efficiently which speeds up the computation of the estimates. 
    Second, it allows the researcher to estimate multiple specifications 
    using the same set of fixed effects at a very low computational cost. 
    Third, the asymptotic variance of the parameters of interest can be 
    consistently estimated using standard routines on the residualized data.
