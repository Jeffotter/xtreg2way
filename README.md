# An Algorithm to Estimate the Two-Way Fixed Effects Model 

The `xtreg2way` package is an algorithm to efficiently estimate a two-way fixed effects model.  This algorithm is adapted from the [Matlab code](https://soma.people.stanford.edu/research) written for [this paper](https://soma.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4171/f/jem-2014-0008.pdf) by Paulo Somaini and Frank A Wolak.
